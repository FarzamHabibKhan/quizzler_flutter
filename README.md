A quiz app that tests your general knowledge. As one of the most popular types of apps on the app stores, you can create your own quiz for other people to enjoy!
The App is a quiz app that asks a bunch of general knowledge 
questions.
Bellow the questions are 2 buttons namely True and False. 
THe user answers the questions using these buttons.

answer as right or wrong by showing:
