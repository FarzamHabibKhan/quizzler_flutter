# quizzler_flutter

## What I created
A quiz app that tests your general knowledge. As one of the most popular types of apps on the app stores, you can create your own quiz for other people to enjoy!
### Description
- Quizzler is a quiz app that asks a bunch of general knowledge questions.
- Below the questions are 2 buttons namely True and False. 
- The user answers the questions using these buttons.
- Below the buttons there is a row that scores each user's answer as right or wrong by showing:
-- a check mark: for right answer.
-- a cross: for wrong answer.

- Dart classes and objects.
- Using class constructors.
- Extracting Widgets to refactor your code.
- private and public modifiers in Dart.
